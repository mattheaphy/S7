## Classes and objects

``` r
library(R7)

range <- new_class("range",
  constructor = function(start, end) {
    new_object(start = start, end = end)
  },
  validator = function(x) {
    if (x@end < x@start) {
      "<range>@end must be greater than or equal to <range>@start"
    }
  },
  properties = list(
    start = "numeric",
    end = "numeric",
    new_property(
      name = "length",
      class = "numeric",
      getter = function(x) x@end - x@start,
      setter = function(x, value) {
        x@end <- x@start + value
        x
      }
    )
  )
)

x <- range(start = 1, end = 10)

x@start
#> [1] 1

x@end
#> [1] 10

x@length
#> [1] 9

x@length <- 5

x@length
#> [1] 5

# incorrect properties throws an error
x@middle
#> Error: Can't find property <range>@middle

# assigning properties verifies the class matches the class of the value
x@end <- "foo"
#> Error: <range>@end must be of class <numeric>:
#> - `value` is of class <character>

# assigning properties runs the validator
x@end <- 0
#> Error: Invalid <range> object:
#> - <range>@end must be greater than or equal to <range>@start

# Print methods for both R7_class objects
object_class(x)
#> <R7_class>
#> @name range
#> @parent <R7_object>
#> @properties
#>  $start  <numeric>
#>  $end    <numeric>
#>  $length <numeric>

# As well as normal R7_objects
x
#> <range> <R7_object>
#> @start  1
#> @end    6
#> @length 5

# Use `.data` to refer to and retrieve the base data type, properties are
# automatically removed, but non-property attributes (such as names) are retained.

text <- new_class("text", parent = "character", constructor = function(text) new_object(.data = text))

y <- text(c(foo = "bar"))

names(y@.data)
#> [1] "foo"
```

## Generics and methods

``` r
text <- new_class("text", parent = "character", constructor = function(text) new_object(.data = text))

foo <- new_generic(name = "foo", signature = "x")

method(foo, "text") <- function(x, ...) paste0("foo-", x)

foo(text("hi"))
#> [1] "foo-hi"
```

## Multiple dispatch

Multiple dispatch uses a table stored in the `methods` property of the
generic. This table is a nested set of hashed environments based on the
classes of the methods. e.g.

For `method(foo, c("character", "numeric"))` the method would be stored
at `foo@methods[["character"]][["numeric"]]`.

At each level the search iteratively searches along objects class
vector.

``` r
number <- new_class("number", parent = "numeric", constructor = function(x) new_object(.data = x))

bar <- new_generic(name = "bar", signature = c("x", "y"))

method(bar, list("character", "numeric")) <- function(x, y, ...) paste0("foo-", x, ":", y)

bar(text("hi"), number(42))
#> [1] "foo-hi:42"
```

## Calling the next method

`next_method()` is used to call the next method for the arguments. This
works by looking up the call stack and retrieving R7 methods which have
already been called, then doing a method search with those methods
excluded. This ensures you cannot call the same method twice.

``` r
method(bar, list("text", "number")) <- function(x, y, ...) {
  res <- next_method()(x, y)
  paste0("2 ", res)
}

bar(text("hi"), number(42))
#> [1] "2 foo-hi:42"
```

## Non-standard evaluation

`method_call()` retains promises for dispatch arguments in basically the
same way as `UseMethod()`, so non-standard evaluation works basically
the same as S3.

``` r
subset2 <- new_generic(name = "subset", signature = "x")

method(subset2, "data.frame") <- function(x, subset = NULL, select = NULL, drop = FALSE, ...) {
  e <- substitute(subset)
  r <- eval(e, x, parent.frame())
  r <- r & !is.na(r)
  nl <- as.list(seq_along(x))
  names(nl) <- names(x)
  vars <- eval(substitute(select), nl, parent.frame())
  x[r, vars, drop = drop]
}

subset2(mtcars, hp > 200, c(wt, qsec))
#>                        wt  qsec
#> Duster 360          3.570 15.84
#> Cadillac Fleetwood  5.250 17.98
#> Lincoln Continental 5.424 17.82
#> Chrysler Imperial   5.345 17.42
#> Camaro Z28          3.840 15.41
#> Ford Pantera L      3.170 14.50
#> Maserati Bora       3.570 14.60
```

### External generics

If you want to define methods for R7 generics defined in another package
you can use `new_extrenal_generic` to declare the external generic, then
add `R7::method_register()` to the `.onLoad` function in your package.
`method_register()` will automatically setup on-load hooks for ‘soft’
dependencies in `Suggests` so the method will be added when the
dependency is eventually loaded.

``` r
.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  R7::method_register()
}

foo <- new_external_generic("pkg1", "foo")

method(foo, list("text", "numeric")) <- function(x, y, ...) paste0("foo-", x, ": ", y)
```

## Design workflow

  - File an issue to discuss the topic and build consensus.
  - Once consensus has been reached, the issue author should create a
    pull request that summarises the discussion in the appropriate `.md`
    file, and request review from all folks who participated the issue
    discussion.
  - Once all participants have accepted the PR, the original author
    merges.

## TODO

  - Objects
      - [x] - A class object attribute, a reference to the class object,
        and retrieved with `object_class()`.
      - [x] - For S3 compatibility, a class attribute, a character
        vector of class names.
      - [x] - Additional attributes storing properties defined by the
        class, accessible with `@/property()`.
  - Classes
      - [x] - R7 classes are first class objects with the following
          - [x] - `name`, a human-meaningful descriptor for the class.
          - [x] - `parent`, the class object of the parent class.
          - [x] - A constructor, an user-facing function used to create
            new objects of this class. It always ends with a call to
            `new_object()` to initialize the class.
          - [x] - A validator, a function that takes the object and
            returns NULL if the object is valid, otherwise a character
            vector of error messages.
          - [x] - properties, a list of property objects
  - Initialization
      - [x] - The constructor uses `new_object()` to initialize a new
        object, this
          - [x] - Inspects the enclosing scope to find the “current”
            class.
          - [ ] - Creates the prototype, by either by calling the parent
            constructor or by creating a base type and adding class and
            `object_class()` attributes to it.
          - [x] - Validates properties then adds to prototype.
          - [x] - Validates the complete object.
  - Shortcuts
      - [ ] - any argument that takes a class object can instead take
        the name of a class object as a string
      - [x] - instead of providing a list of property objects, you can
        instead provide a named character vector.
  - Validation
      - [x] - valid\_eventually
      - [x] - valid\_implicitly
  - Unions
      - [x] - Used in properties to allow a property to be one of a set
        of classes
      - [x] - In method dispatch as a convenience for defining a method
        for multiple classes
  - Properties
      - [x] - Accessed using `property()` / `property<-`
      - [x] - Accessed using `@` / `@<-`
      - [x] - A name, used to label output
      - [x] - A optional class or union
      - [x] - An optional accessor functions, both getter and setters
      - [x] - Properties are created with `new_property()`
  - Generics
      - [x] - It knows its name and the names of the arguments in its
        signature
      - [x] - Calling `new_generic()` defines a new generic
      - [ ] - By convention, any argument that takes a generic function,
        can instead take the name of a generic function supplied as a
        string
  - Methods
      - Registration
          - [x] - Methods are defined by calling method\<-(generic,
            signature, method):
          - [x] - generic is a generic function.
          - [x] - signature is a
              - [x] - single class object
              - [x] - a class union
              - [x] - list of class objects/unions
              - [x] - a character vector.
          - [x] - method is a compatible function
          - [x] - `new_method` is designed to work at run-time
              - [x] - `new_method` should optionally take a package
                version, so the method is only registered if the package
                is newer than the version.
          - [ ] - Can define methods where one of the arguments is
            missing
          - [ ] - Can define methods where one of the arguments has any
            type
      - Dispatch
          - [x] - Dispatch is nested, meaning that if there are multiple
            arguments in the generic signature, it will dispatch on the
            first argument, then the second.
          - [x] - A `plot()` generic dispatching on `x`, e.g. `plot <-
            function(x) { method(plot, object_class(x))(x) }`
          - [x] - A `publish()` that publishes an object `x` to a
            destination `y`, dispatching on both arguments,
            e.g. `publish <- function(x, y, ...) { method(publish,
            list(object_class(x), object_class(y)))(x, y, ...) }`
          - [x] - `...` is not used for dispatch
          - [x] - R7 generics can dispatch with base type objects
          - [x] - R7 generics can dispatch with S3 objects
          - [x] - R7 generics can dispatch with S4 objects
          - [x] - `next_method()` can dispatch on multiple arguments,
            avoiding methods that have already been called.
          - [x] - Generics forward promises to methods, so methods can
            use non-standard evaluation.
  - Compatibility
      - S3
          - [x] - Since the class attribute has the same semantics as
            S3, S3 dispatch should be fully compatible.
          - [x] - The new generics should also be able to handle legacy
            S3 objects.
          - [x] - `method()` falls back to single argument S3 dispatch
            if the R7 dispatch fails.
          - [ ] - `method()` uses S3 group generics as well
      - S4
          - [x] - Since the new generics will fallback to S3 dispatch,
            they should support S4 objects just as S3 generics support
            them now.
  - Documentation
      - [ ] - Generate index pages that list the methods for a generic
        or the methods with a particular class in their signature
